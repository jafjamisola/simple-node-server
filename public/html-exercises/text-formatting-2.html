              As you have already noticed, I know a little French (thanks to FRCH 10!) and a little Arabic as well (<abbr title="Thank you, my love!">Shukran, habibi!</abbr>)
              I was born in Manila, grew up in Pasig, grew a little more in Abu Dhabi, then came back to the Philippines to finish growing.

                  I'm often called "<em>Amor</em>" or "<em>Jess</em>", my birthday is on the 18th of February, and I have a sweet tooth.
              </h4.5>
              <h3>
                  <strong>A serious sweet tooth.</strong>
              </h3>
              <h4.5>
                  I could totally eat a whole cake and love it until the last bite (but of course I'd get bloated to the point of no return). 
                  Nevertheless, I still love eating sweets. Be it <abbr title="ugh yes pls">cupcakes</abbr>, <abbr title="glazed, especially ugggggh">doughnuts</abbr>, <abbr title="milk and white only. I don't like dark chocolates">chocolates</abbr>, sugar cookies, all types of cookies, really.

                 All that talking made me hungry so let me change the topic. 
                 I went to three high schools. Yes, <em>three</em>. The first two years, I attended <abbr title="Pioneer International Private School"><strong>PIPS</strong></abbr>. It was in <em>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</em>.
                 The third year, I spent at <abbr title="Blue, Red, Gold">Colegio de San Lorenzo</abbr> (<em>Quezon City</em>). 
                 And the school were I graduated, Sacred Heart Academy of Pasig, was were I also attended school <abbr title="of course that was before we went abroad">when I was young</abbr>.
                 Now, here I am. At the premier university. Studying <abbr title="AKA everything I don't understand">all that jazz</abbr> about economics. 
                 I didn't really know what to expect, other than I thought economics in college would be similar to what we were taught in high school. <strong>WRONG.</strong> That thought was utterly wrong. It's some hard sh*t. But here I am. Still crawling to the finish line. No matter how long it takes me. 
                 <br><br><br>
                 Studying in UP changes you. You learn so much more outside the classroom than in. I learned that <q>Grades are just numbers in the end, ang kailangan mo lang talaga ay <em>tres.</em></q>
                 And I believe that is all I need. To reach my goals, to be on the path. 
                 <br><br><br><br>
                 <h3>So until then, here is where I leave you.</h3>
