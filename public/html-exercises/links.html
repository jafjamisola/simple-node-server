      <h4><abbr title="for me, that is">The Three Best Movies</abbr></h4>
       
            <p><blockquote><strong>Spirited Away</strong></blockquote>
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away"><img src="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29000000/Spirited-Away-spirited-away-29095900-1024-768.jpg" width="300"></a>
                <br> 
                The movie is mostly seen as a coming-of-age film, where Chihiro (protagonist) enters the spirit world with little to no knowledge about it and forced to act <abbr title="since her parents turned into pigs">independently.</abbr>
                What I absolutely love about it, is the subtle entrance of the love affair between <abbr title="Chihiro's given name in the Spirit World">Sen</abbr> and Haku (a river spirit who was always saved her).
                You don't even see it coming. It is because of the apparent youth of the two characters [when in fact, Haku's an old river spirit], that most viewers tend to <em>not</em> think that this film is a romance. 
                That this is just a tasteful animated film about a young girl who lost her parents and would be at the beck and call of an evil lady just to get them back. 
                But it's  <a href="http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/09/25/there-s-an-incredible-hidden-message-in-spirited-away-and-it-will-shock-you-2297900?lt_source=external,manual"><em>so much more than that.</em></a>
            </p>
           
           <p><blockquote><strong>The Harry Potter Series</strong></blockquote>
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)"><img src="http://www.film.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-movie-photo-104.jpg" width="300"></a>
                <br> 
                I don't think this needs much justification.
            </p>
          <p><blockquote><strong>Wreck-It Ralph</strong></blockquote>
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph"><img src="http://www.animationmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Wreck-It-Ralph-post3.jpg" width="300"></a>
                <br> 
                This film brings nostalgia and pleasurable visuals (the candy colors, guys), paired with such a relatable plot. No wonder it was such a hit, and it is still a beautiful, fun film to watch with anyone. Ralph is a character with so much to give; he is presented as a bad guy but it's hardly his personality. 
                I find that really beautiful. In this world we live in, labels are always present; always given to people regardless of who they really are, as long as society, AKA every one else, thinks so. And that was what the film managed to accomplish.
                Needless to say, it is a timeless film.

      <h4>The Three Best Songs</h4>
       
            <p><blockquote><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk">Style</a></em> by Taylor Swift</blockquote>
                <br> 
                I have been in love with Taylor Swift's songs since I was 12. She has always talked directly to her listeners, like she's singing what's happening in our [listeners'] lives. And this song is just one of those that are <em>soooo</em> nice to hear.
            </p>
           
           <p><blockquote><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBHQbu5rbdQ">Worth It</a></em> by Fifth Harmony</blockquote>
                <br>
                I love songs that are very enjoyable and fun to listen to. This song is it for me right now. When I hear this song, it makes me want to dance.
            </p>
           <p><blockquote><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLx4zzMdRA">Trouble</a></em> by Iggy Azalea feat. Jennifer Hudson</blockquote>
                <br>
               Iggy Azalea's voice is one-of-a-kind and her songs are very catchy. No wonder she skyrocketed to fame in a little time. Matched with Jennifer Hudson's skill set, this song is a very good one.
