						<blockquote> 
							J. C. R. Licklider had the chance to make history when he was hired by Jack Ruina, a man from the United States Department of Defense, under <abbr title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">DARPA</abbr>.

					<p>
						In <font size="8">1964</font>, he left the project which was five years before the ARPANET went live. It was his dream of realizing universal networking that gave 
						the motivation that led people such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Roberts_(scientist)">Lawrence Roberts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Robert Taylor</a> to further the ARPANET development. 
						Licklider later returned to lead the IPTO in 1973 for two years.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The first ARPANET link was connected between the University of California, Los Angeles and Stanford Research Institute on <font size="8">October 29, 1969</font>.
						On December 5 the same year, the University of Utah and University of California, Santa Barbara was added to the network.

						<blockquote>"In <font size="8">1965</font>, Donald Davies of the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) proposed a national data network based on packet-switching. The proposal was not taken up nationally, 
						but by 1970 he had designed and built the Mark I packet-switched network to meet the needs of the multidisciplinary laboratory and prove the technology under operational conditions. 
						By <font size="8">1976</font> 12 computers and 75 terminal devices were attached and more were added until the network was replaced in <font size="8">1986</font>." </blockquote>

						<center><strong><h3>UUCP and Usenet</h3></strong></center>
						<blockquote>At Duke University, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, thought up the idea of using Bourne shell scripts to transfer news 
						and messages on a serial line UUCP connection with universities near theirs, namely: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, circa <font size="8">1979</font>.
						UUCPnet, as it would be named later on, also made links and provided gateways between FidoNet and dial-up BBS hosts.
