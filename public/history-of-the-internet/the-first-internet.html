						<blockquote> 
							<center><strong><h3>TCP/IP</h3></strong></center>
							<a href="http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_kahn.htm">Robert E. Kahn</a>, from DARPA and ARPANET took 
							<a href="http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_cerf.htm">Vinton Cerf</a> (Standford University) under his 
							wing to help him connect and unify the several network methods present during their time. 
							
						</blockquote>
					</p>
						
					<p>
						<h4>Kahn described four goals for the design of the Transmission Control Protocol or TCP:</h4>
						<blockquote>
						<ul>
							<li>Network connectivity. Any network could connect to another network through a gateway.</li>
							<li>Distribution. There would be no central network administration or control.</li>
							<li>Error recovery. Lost packets would be retransmitted.</li>
							<li>Black box design. No internal changes would have to be made to a network to connect it to other networks.</li>
						</ul>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						According to the website Living Internet, "(t)he design was subsequently layered into two protocols, TCP/IP, where 
						TCP handles high level services like retransmission of lost packets, 
						and IP handles packet addressing and transmission."

						<center><strong><h3>Domain Name System</h3></strong></center>
						"The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or 
						any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names 
						assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates domain names, which can be easily
						memorized by humans, to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of computer services and devices worldwide."
						
					<p>
						 "For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 
						 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, the DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location 
						 on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same host name. Users take advantage of this 
						 when they use meaningful 
						 Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services."
					</p>
					
					<p>
						"The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for DNS zone authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), 
						SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME)."
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<center><h3>Ethernet</h3></center>
						<blockquote>"Ethernet was developed at Xerox PARC between 1973 and 1974. It was inspired by ALOHAnet, which Robert Metcalfe had studied 
						as part of his PhD dissertation. The idea was first documented in a memo that Metcalfe wrote on May 22, 1973, where he named 
						it after the disproven luminiferous ether as an "omnipresent, completely-passive medium for the propagation of electromagnetic 
						waves". In 1975, Xerox filed a patent application listing Metcalfe, David Boggs, Chuck Thacker, and Butler Lampson as 
						inventors. 
						In 1976, after the system was deployed at PARC, Metcalfe and Boggs published a seminal paper."</blockquote>
						
					</p>
					
					<p>
						"Since then, Ethernet technology has evolved to meet new bandwidth and market requirements. In addition to computers, 
						Ethernet is now used to interconnect appliances and other personal devices. It is used in industrial applications and is 
						quickly replacing legacy data transmission systems 
						in the world's telecommunications networks. By 2010, the market for Ethernet equipment amounted to over $16 billion per year."
